# VVGL Player

WebGL Player for VVID files

VVGL is a WebGL based rendering engine for LRN files. This should be considered an alternative rendering engine to SVG, one of the major components of vv.js.

## Getting started

VVGL uses a node, webpack build environment. Make sure Node, Webpack, Yarn etc... are all installed

**Install dependencies**

    npm install

**data.json**

You need a specially formatted JSON file. One is already included in the vvid folder, and you can generate more from src/encoder.js, which takes in the outputs from vectorization, and outputs a data.json file

*Run demo file*


    yarn JSONFILE=vvid/data.json demo:serve


## Background

**WebGL**
To understand the VVGL player, you'll need to learn the fundamentals of WebGL.  [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) has a great introduction to WebGL. In addition, [Khronos.org](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki) and [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/) are good references for OpenGL, and the WebGL API respectively.

**Bezier curves**
On top of WebGL, it's critical that you understand Bezier curves (and specifically Cubic Bezier curves). There is a good animation [here](https://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/), a few [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYccz1Ha34).

**Linear Algebra**
It's also helpful to have a background in basic linear algebra, and specifically vector and matrix multiplication.


## Theory

To understand how the WebGL player works at a theory level, you only need to know two things:

* How to render a bezier curve using linear algebra
* How to render complex polygons as a series of triangles

**Bezier Curves as Linear Algebra**

The formula for a cubic Bezier curve is as follows

![bezier](docs/bezier.svg)

You can substitute the t-values with easier to read variables

![bezier](docs/coefficients.svg ==250x)

The bezier curve equation then becomes

![bezier](docs/linalg1.svg =250x)
